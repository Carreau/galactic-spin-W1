    "Black holes are ***MACHOs*** or Massive Compact Halo Objects. They are hard to detect with our present technology, especially if they have small masses. For example, a black hole with the mass of our sun has an event horizon radius of 3 km. A solar-mass sized black hole would be so tiny that the only way we would be able to see it is by gravitational microlensing (blackhole passing in front of a star). \n",
    "\n",
    "The left photo is an arbitrary face-on galaxy (NGC 6814) for a better visualization of the spread of the number of black holes. ***Each dot represents 1 million tiny black holes***. \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the number and mass of each black hole can change the velocities of the stars in a galaxy (velocity curve), according to Newton's law of gravitation.<br>\n",
    "There are three sliders that can change the velocity curve of the dark halo. \n",
    "1. ***Number of millions of tiny black holes***: We need to start with an incredibly high number of tiny black holes to account for the dark matter halo curve. Starting with merely 50 million, all the way up to 500 million tiny black holes, the velocity curve changes drastically.\n",
    "2. ***Mass of each tiny black hole (in solar masses)***: Starting from 0.1 solar masses, and up to 3.8 solar masses (which is the smallest black hole ever discovered), this slider can change the mass of each black hole. \n",
    "3. ***Cutoff radius***: The cutoff radius (also called \"scale radius\") indicates where the density falls off by a factor of e (~2.7). Adjusting this factor changes where the \"bump\" of the curve is located. \n",

    "The rotation curve of NGC 7814 (represented by blue data points in the right graph) is emulated after Fraternali et al. (2011). The graph to the right represents an interactive rotation curve of NGC 7814 similar to what you can see in our rotation curve widget program, however, in this case all components have been fixed except for the dark matter component (green line), and now it is modeled based on a hypothetical mass distribution of small black holes.\n",
    "### Left Graph:\n",
    "The left graph shows a visual helper of what the rotation curve is physically describing (note that the galaxy image used is NOT of NGC 7814, but a similar spiral galaxy, NGC 6814). Here, each dot represents 1 million black holes (an arbitrary scaling factor). Keep careful watch as you move the sliders to see each \"black hole\" (red dots) change in quantity and size. It's up to you to choose how many black holes (by factors of 1 million) and masses of each black hole in solar masses (1 solar mass = $2 × 10^{30}$ kilograms) to find a \"best fit\" rotation curve, which is to say, a mass distribution of black holes that would most closely match real observations.\n",
