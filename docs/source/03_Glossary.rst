    Arcsecond 
      Unit of an angle denoting how large something appears in the sky.
    
    Bulge
      Dense, spherical core of the galaxy.
      
    Central mass density
      The density of dark matter at the center of the galaxy. Changing this value changes the magnitude of the dark matter curve.
      
    Concentration parameter
      Also known as the bulge Sersic parameter. "Describes the curvature of the profile in a radius-magnitude plot" (Noordermeer 2008). 
    
    Core radius
      Indicates the distance from galactic center where the density falls off by a factor of *e* (~2.7). Adjusting this factor changes where the "bump" of the curve is located. Synonyms: cutoff radius, scale radius.
    
    Dark matter
      A placeholder to account for the matter in spiral galaxies that is `missing` based on our observations of galactic motion.  Related words: Dark Matter halo. 
    
    Dark matter halo
      A disk-shaped distribution of dark matter that is most dense at some distance from the galactic center.

    Density profile
      The mass distribution of matter in the galaxy.
      
    Disk
      A large, relatively flat component of the galaxy.

    Fitting
      The process of adjusting unknown parameters in order to match a theoretical equation to measured data.
    
    Gravitational constant (G)
       The constant of proportionality used to calculate effects of gravity.
       In SI units, G = 6.67e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
    
    Inclination angle
      The angle of the galaxy from the horizontal.  
    
    Interstellar gas
      Gas between stars and galaxies. 
    
    Isothermal
      Having a constant temperature.
      
    Luminous matter
      All matter that emits visible light in galaxies. Synonyms: light matter, visible matter, baryonic matter.
      
    kpc
      Unit of distance; kiloparsec. 1 kpc = 3262 light years = 3.086e+19 meters = 1.917e+16 miles.
    
    MACHO
       MAssive Compact Halo Object. A type of object that emits little to no light, such as brown dwarfs or rogue planets.  
    
    Mass-to-light ratio (M/L ratio)
      The ratio of how much mass there is compared to how much light the body emits; how much mass it is expected from the light source. Variation in the mass-to-light ratio means there is a wider range of masses that are plausible for the stellar component.
    
    Measured datapoints
      Measured velocities of stars and gas in a galaxy. Synonyms: measured velocities.
    
    Mpc
      Unit of distance. Megaparsec: 1 Mpc = 1000 kpc.
      
    NGC
      New General Catalogue of galaxies.
    
    Photometry
      The measurement of light emitted from astronomical objects.
    
    Prefactor
      A parameter that multiplies/directly scales the other information in an equation. Synonyms\: scaling parameter. Related words\: M/L ratio
      
    Radial velocity
      The speed stars and gas are moving at different distances from the center of the galaxy.

    Reduced chi-squared value
      A measure of how close the data and theory are to one another. In a strictly statistical sense, a reduced chi-squared of zero represents a perfect fit. However, a reduced chi-squared much less than 1 often indicates that more parameters were used than represented by the physical system, and we may be simply connecting the measured data points. 
      
    Rotation curve
      A plot of a galaxy's radial velocity versus the radius or distance from the center. 
    
    Solar mass
      Mass of the Sun, equal to 1.989e30 kilograms.
    
    Theoretical rotation curve
      A rotation curve that has been modeled from known parameters that is then used to match observed data. 
    
    UGC
      Uppsala General Catalogue of galaxies.
      
    Zero-point luminosity
