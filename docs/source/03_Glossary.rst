    Arcsecond 
      Unit of an angle of how large something appears in the sky.
    
    Bulge
      Dense spherical core of the galaxy.
      
    Central mass density
      The central mass density is the density at the center of the galaxy, changing this value changes the magnitude of the Dark Matter curve.
      
    Concentration parameter
      Also known as the bulge Sersic parameter "describes the curvature of the profile in a radius-magnitude plot" (Noordermeer 2008). 
    
    Core radius
      The core radius indicates where the density falls off by a factor of e (~2.7). Adjusting this factor changes where the "bump" of the curve is located. Related words: cutoff radius, scale radius.
    
    Dark matter
      Dark matter is a placeholder to account for the matter in spiral galaxies that is `missing` ...  Related words: Dark Matter halo. 
    
    Density profile
      The mass distribution of matter in the galaxy.
      
    Disk
      ...
    
    Inclination angle
      The angle of the galaxy from the horizontal.
    
    Fitting
      ...
    
    Gravitational constant (G)
      ...
      
    Interstellar gas
      Gas between stars and galaxies. 
    
    Isothermal
      ...
      
    Luminous matter
      All matter that we are able to `see` in galaxies. Related words: light matter, visible matter, baryonic matter.
      
    kpc
      Unit of distance. kiloparsec: 1 kpc = 3262 light years = 3.086e+19 meters = 1.917e+16 miles.
    
    MACHO
       Massive Compact Halo Object.
    
    Mass-to-light ratio
      The ratio of how much mass there is compared to how much it is visible. How much mass it is expected from the light source. The variation in the mass-to-light ratio means there is a wider range of masses that are plausible for the stellar component. Related words: M/L
    
    Measured datapoints
      Measured velocities of stars and gas in a galaxy. Related words: measured velocities.
    
    Mpc
      Unit of distance. Megaparsec: 1 Mpc = 1000 kpc.
      
    NGC
      New General Catalogue of galaxies.
    
    Photometry
      ...
    
    Prefactor
      ... Related words: scaling parameter, M/L ratio
      
    Radial velocity
      The speed stars and gas are moving at different distances from the center of the galaxy.

    Reduced chi-squared value
      In a strictly statistical sense, a reduced chi-squared of zero represents a perfect fit. However, a reduced chi-squared much less than 1 often indicates that more parameters were used than represented by the physical system. We would be simply connecting the measured data points. 
      
    Rotation curve
      A plot of a galaxy's radial velocity versus the radius or distance from the center. 
    
    Solar mass
      Mass of the Sun. Approximately equal to 1.989e30 kilograms 
    
    Theoretical rotation curve
      ...
    
    UGC
      Uppsala General Catalogue of galaxies.
      
    Zero-point luminosity
      ...
