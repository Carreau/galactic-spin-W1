*Galactic Spin Workshop 1* - The Basics of Rotation Curves
==========================================================

The purpose of this workshop code is to guide the user through the fundamental aspects of rotation curves. 
This includes discussing what a rotation curve is, how they are measured, and how we model them. 
In order to allow users to fit models to real data, we pull rotation curves data on various galaxies from `SPARC <http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/>`_,
a database of galactic data. We use the models by `Casertano <https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/203.3.735>`_ and 
`Noordermeer <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12837.x>`_ when modeling components of the rotation curve.


The documentation does not contain a review of the physics implemented in the library.
