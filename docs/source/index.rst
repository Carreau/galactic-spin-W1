*Galactic Spin Workshop 1* - The Basics of Rotation Curves
==========================================================

The purpose of this workshop is to guide the user through the fundamental aspects of spiral galaxies' rotation curves. 
This includes discussing what a rotation curve is, plotting the measured rotational velocities, constructing a rotation curve model for each component of the galaxy, calculating total rotation, and fitting the total curve to the measured data. 
The workshop includes rotation curve calculations of the dark matter halo, bulge, and a central supermassive black hole component. We use the models by `Casertano <https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/203.3.735>`_, 
`Noordermeer <https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12837.x>`_, and `Jimenez <https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2003.06165.x>`_ when modeling components of the rotation curve. All other components are imported from the `SPARC (Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves) database <http://astroweb.cwru.edu/SPARC/>`_. 


The documentation does not contain a review of the physics implemented in the library.
